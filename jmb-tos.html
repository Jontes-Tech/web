You also agree to let me, Jonatan "Jonte" Holmgren, add or remove anything to these Terms of Service, and you commit responsibility of checking back at these terms of service regularly. Even if the bot is named after Jonte, it is not mine. I host a project called JMusicbot on /dev/bedwarsplayer's server hardware. JMusicbot's terms of service apply. If you, the copyright holder for any music you do not want played with this bot, or the owner of a platform scraped by this bot, such as YouTube, Inc, or a mother company such as Google, Inc, please contact me at jonatan at jontes dot page to sort this out. If there's not a button below, please visit this website with Javascript enabled and your browser "reading mode" off. I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS MUSICBOT. THIS BOT COMES WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRENTY NOR LIABILITY ON MY PART. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COPYRIGHT ISSUES.</p><button onclick="window.location.href=atob('aHR0cHM6Ly9kaXNjb3JkLmNvbS9hcGkvb2F1dGgyL2F1dGhvcml6ZT9jbGllbnRfaWQ9OTU0Njk2MzM4NzYxNzM2MTkyJnBlcm1pc3Npb25zPTMxNDg4MDAmc2NvcGU9Ym90')">I have read and agree to the Terms of Service</button> </body></html>
