                <p class="p">This tutorial was written for PulseEffects by Markus Schmidt (schmidt@boomshop.net)
                    on November 2019 and updated two years later for the new Easy Effects on PipeWire. It was later slightly reworded by a third party.</p>

                        <p class="p">If you're a notebook user relying on your internal speakers and you -
                            like me - own a model suffering from a tinny, clanging sound, Easy Effects is
                            your salvation!</p>
                        <p class="p">Commercial operating systems on laptops these days often come with
                            software like Dolby Theatre and the like to enhance the sound of lousy notebook
                            speakers to something more substantial and acoustically rich. Under Linux, Easy
                            Effects will do the job for you, although, compared to the commercial pendants,
                            there's some manual tweaking required until the community sets up a database
                            with presets for common machines.</p>
                        <p class="p">This DSP software comes with everything needed to fatten the sound of
                            your laptop speakers with a flexibility never found in other operating systems.
                            Unfortunately the drawback of this flexibility is that average users will get
                            lost in the sheer amount of possibilities. That's why this tutorial was created.

                        <p class="p">We will attack the problems one by one utilizing specific signal
                            processors, deliberately renouncing Equalizers. Equalizers are not of any help
                            here but tend to make these kinds of problems even worse. This is because of the
                            nature of this processor, but also because users tend to add to the signal
                            (additive equalization) instead of trying to eliminate problems by removing from
                            the signal (subtractive equalization) like it is usually done in the
                            professional world.</p>
                        <p class="p">But even subtractive equalization wouldn't be of any help since the
                            amplifiers and speakers in a notebook are not loud enough by default, so trying
                            to eliminate problems this way leads to a quiet and still castrated sound. And
                            raising the volume afterwards generally leads to distorted sounds and other
                            problems because the system was at its limits beforehand and just fiddling with
                            the frequency response doesn't help at all.</p>

                                                here. Movies occupy this range with explosions, rumbling

                                                missing on notebooks and tablets. Technically speaking it's

                                                engines and shotguns are found in this range. We're talking
                                                about ~250 Hz - ~750 Hz.

                        <p class="p">It is quite snappy, has lots of well defined substance, clear and
                            bright highs, present vocals, comes with a very balanced frequency response and
                            is a great mix in combination with great mastering. Afterwards I tested against
                            various movies and other stuff like talks, classical music and the like and was
                            convinced of the result. Well produced, modern pop music (avoid the 80's and
                            90's stuff) is always a good test signal for this kind of job. Movies are way
                            too dynamic, so is classical music, and they normally don't cover a steady,
                            broad frequency range like this kind of signal.</p>
                        <p class="p">We will not be able to make the notebook bounce. What is the goal here
                            is that everything contained in the mix gets audible in a well balanced manner
                            and to gain a present, upfront, broad and hopefully rich sound.</p>
                        <p class="p">I assume you don't utilize a player or source which is able to produce
                            levels above 0 dB. I also assume you don't use e.g. video players volume bar to
                            lower the volume of your source. This approach works well for defined, mixed and
                            mastered sound sources like music, movies, tv and the like, played back at 100%
                            volume in the player. Set the desired volume directly on your hardware <span

                            something more substantial but at least we'll be able to get the best out of the
                            physical boundaries of these transducers.</p>
                        <p class="p">Every parameter we are gonna set absolutely depends on your situation
                            and the hardware you've got. Every notebook has its own frequency response and
                            dynamic range so there's no panacea. But the audio signal processors, their
                            order and their missions are well defined and reproducible.</p>
                        <p class="p">Don't care about clipping in the plugins level meters. The signal will
                            be processed as 32 bit numbers internally (check title bar) which gives a
                            non-clipping overhead of hundreds of decibels. The only thing that shouldn't
                            happen is that there's clipping when the signal hits the sound card DAC
                            (Digital-to-Analog Converter), which would result in digital distortion.</p>

                                                used. As I explained earlier, as soon as the signal hits the
                                                sound card DAC it has to be below 0 dB, otherwise it will
                                                result in a distorted, messy sound.</p>
                                            <p class="p">Delete already present processors in the list, then
                                                add the Limiter. You will not hear any difference, which is
                                                what we expect. It will hit in as soon as we start messing
                                                up the signal with all the other processors. Set PreAmp to 0
                                                dB, Lookahead to 4 ms, Attack to 2 ms and Release to 8 ms.

                                            <p class="p">A Limiter monitors the signal in (nearly) realtime
                                                and detects peaks over a certain Threshold, in our case 0
                                                dB. Set also Stereo Link to 100%, Oversampling to Half x4,
                                                disable External Sidechain and Auto Leveling and leave
                                                remaining options to their defaults.</p>
                                            <p class="p">As soon as a peak is detected, it starts lowering
                                                the volume constantly (within the Lookahead) until the peak
                                                will be below Threshold. Afterwards it raises the volume
                                                again (within release time frame) until it is back to
                                                normal. This way we avoid signals above Threshold hitting
                                                the DAC without being noticed too much. If one tries to
                                                overdo limiting, it will definitely result in distortion and
                                                other side effects, but in our case it's just a
                                                fire-and-forget troubleshooter so we can concentrate on the
                                                results without trying to mess with levelling over and over
                                                again.</p>

                                                will cut off everything below a frequency and will let

                                                is definitely below your laptop's speakers abilities).
                                                Continuously raise the frequency by 10 Hz until you start
                                                hearing a change in the lower end of the audible signal,
                                                which should be around 130-160 Hz. Subtract 10% (or 15 Hz)
                                                and set it as the Filters frequency. On my machine it is 145

                                                position, between the Filter and the Limiter. Set the Floor
                                                to 10 Hz and forget about it (we already removed everything
                                                below the Filter plugin cutoff frequency). Raise Harmonics
                                                to 10 and start with a Scope of 200 Hz. Now start raising
                                                the Amount continuously until the bass takes over the whole
                                                energy, which is definitely too much. For me it works best
                                                at +24 dB. Which is huge but my ThinkPad P1 has the worst

                                            <p class="p">What happens is that the Bass Enhancer adds
                                                frequencies to the signal which weren't there before. While
                                                an Equalizer only raises stuff which is already in the
                                                signal, a Bass Enhancer improves the lower end by adding
                                                distortion to a specific frequency range. This kind of
                                                distortion adds so called Harmonics to the signal which is a
                                                multiple of existing frequencies. On the Blend slider you
                                                can choose seamlessly between 2nd and 3rd Harmonics, which
                                                means that a frequency of 100 Hz produces a new signal of
                                                200/300/400/600/800/900 Hz... at varying (due to the
                                                Harmonics setting) and constantly decreasing levels. This

                                                above a certain Threshold. It adds a simple multiplication
                                                to the signal defined by the Ratio. If the Threshold is set

                                                become -18 dB. In this example one can then raise the Makeup

                                                of all we're rendering loud signals quieter to then raise
                                                the overall volume, which leads to less dynamic range with
                                                quiet parts becoming more audible.</p>
                                            <p class="p">The timing settings affect the "speed" of the
                                                compression. Attack means that a signal needs to go over
                                                Threshold for this amount of time until the Compressor
                                                reaches the full (negative) amplification. Release defines
                                                the amount of time the signal has to stay below Threshold
                                                until the amplification is back to 1 again.</p>
                                            <p class="p">A Multiband Compressor splits the signal in various
                                                frequency ranges to work on them exclusively with dedicated
                                                compression stages. This means that a very loud bass drum
                                                would not affect a crash cymbal, since they are clearly
                                                located in different bands.</p>

                                            <p class="p">Add the Stereo Tools and place it at the fourth
                                                position, after Multiband Compressor and before Limiter.
                                                This tool has a lot of functionality but we only need just a
                                                single parameter. Switch to the "Output" tab and set the
                                                parameter Stereo Base to 0.25. That's it.</p>
                                            <p class="p">Stereo Base acts on the two channels. It adds
                                                inverted signals crossover-wise. This way one can bring a
                                                full stereo signal down to mono seamlessly (by going
                                                negative values, -1 is fully mono) but also raise the stereo
                                                base by choosing positive numbers. This setting has lots of
                                                side effects, so avoid overdoing it! One of the bigger
                                                problems is that it reduces the bass range due to different
                                                effects, which is something we <span

                            was quite convinced. After installing my Linux system the enthusiasm was totally
                            gone - the sound turned into a squawking, pressure-less something. It became
                            clear that all problems of the internal speakers where due to the missing sound
