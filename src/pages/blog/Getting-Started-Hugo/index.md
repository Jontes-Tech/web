Click "Quick Start" on the image bellow for installation instructions  
[![GoHugo.io Website](GoHugo.IO.png)](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
Then open a terminal and run ```hugo new site sitename```
This will create a new folder with Hugo. 

### Downloading a theme
Now we will download a theme. This can be done [here](https://themes.gohugo.io/). Follow the installation guide for the theme you want. 

### Previewing the site
Run ```hugo server``` and browse to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to preview it.

### Customizing the config.yml
Edit the file ```config.yaml``` to your preference.

### Adding own articles.
In the /content folder there _should_ be a folder called ```post``` or ```posts``` or something similar. If not follow the intructions for the theme you use on how to create on. Now create the file with the name you want in your URL bar for the article (This one is "hugo") with the file extention ".md"

### Hosting
I like to use Netlify to host websites for free, click [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/)
