I wanted to try doing a Raspberry Pi project, so I got myself a Raspberry Pi Zero W (but Pi Zero 2 is better for this), a NOIR camera, a Bright Pi, a power bank, and a power cable. And then I put it all together, put my 16GB memory card into my computer, and installed Motion Eye OS following this guide:

[Guide by Arrow.com](https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/motioneyeos-camera-setup-on-raspberry-pi-zero-w)
After following that guide, just put your Raspberry Pi in a birdbox and you're all set. We ended up not using the IR lighting, because we got enough light from the little entrence, but I'm glad we had the option. I think this was a fun project, but at the time the Raspi Zero 2 W didn't exist, but it would signicantly improve the quality of the video as well as the framerate.
